Draw a question from the fishbowl and discuss with your friends!

Suggestions:
1. Limit discussions to 4-5 people for maximum enjoyment.
2. Go around the table and have each person answer each question. Feel free to skip questions if desired.
3. Have everyone take turns drawing questions and being the first to answer!
